This folder is used for RINGS project at Rutgers University. Any documentation is welcome. Students can share their codes that are used on orbit.

When uploading codes/images, please put them in a folder with a name (like. server-client model-Cheng Fang ) including the environment where the code is running (better with a .yml file).
