# REALTIME: an NSF RINGS project

Welcome to the main repository for the [Rutgers WINLAB](https://winlab.rutgers.edu/) project [REALTIME: Resilient Edge-cloud Autonomous Learning with Timely Inferences](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2148104&HistoricalAwards=false) at [WINLAB](https://winlab.rutgers.edu/), generously supported by the [US National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/).

This project is about developing frameworks for real-time operation, online decision-making, and offline training of ML-based applications that must be resilient to data, application, user, and system changes. We are focused on four facets:

1. Developing edge-centric distributed ML models to enable real-time inferences at mobile devices and fast distributed semi-supervised training.
2. Using age-of-information timeliness metrics to understand real-time inference methods and system operation and optima,ly balance mobile computation against network resources.
3. Creating privacy metrics for real-time and online operation of edge-assisted ML. 
4. Building a proof-of-concept prototype on the [NSF COSMOS](https://cosmos-lab.org/) testbed in New York City to validate feasibility and evaluate device and system resilience for representative applications.
